\section{Regarding the computation of strainlines}
\label{sec:regarding_the_computation_of_strainlines}
As outlined in~\cref{sub:a_framework_for_computing_smooth_strainlines}, a
special sort of rectifying linear interpolation routine was implemented in
order to eliminate local orientational discontinuities in the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$
strain eigenvector field. The logical next step would be to consider a larger
local subset of grid points, for instance, the $3\times3$ or $4\times4$ square
of the 9 or 16 nearest neighbors, respectively, systematically reorientating the
eigenvectors if necessary, and then using a higher order interpolation scheme
in order to approximate the local strain eigenvector. This sort of
generalization could make the strainline computation process more robust ---
although the linear approximation approach proved sufficient for the
velocity field considered here, that may not be the case for more complex or
volatile flow systems.

The classical Runge-Kutta method, with a numerical step length
$\Delta=10^{-3}$, was used for all computations of strainlines, regardless
of which integration scheme had been used for the advection of tracers,
as mentioned in~\cref{sub:extracting_hyperbolic_lcss_from_strainlines}. This
was a conscientious choice, based on the idea of using the available information
in the flow maps with the same degree of precision for all integrator
configurations. If, however, the entire process of numerical integration,
including both the advection of tracers and the calculation of strainlines,
were to be performed with the same integrator configuration, comparisons
between the resulting LCSs could have been misleading, as in, the strain
information present in the flow maps would necessarily not have been utilized
to the full extent. For instance, the LCSs curves obtained by means of the Euler
method, shown in figure~\ref{fig:lcs_euler}, could have exhibited even
more false positives and negatives if the same method was used in order to
obtain strainlines as well, due to the inherent inaccuracy of the Euler scheme.

An alternative approach to the numerical integration of strainlines, would be
to make use of a high order adaptive steplength method. This could, in
principle, reduce the required computational time, in addition to reducing
the impact of floating-point arithmetic error. However, in order to encapsulate
the local strain dynamics accurately, the embedded automatic step size control
should probably be more elaborate than the implementation outlined in
\cref{sub:on_the_implementation_of_embedded_runge_kutta_methods}. In particular,
it would be advisable to incorporate the local strainline curvature somehow,
in order to minimize deviations from the \emph{true} trajectories. Furthermore,
the use of a higher order strainline might prove a fruitless exercise, unless
a higher order strain eigendirection routine, as discussed above, was
implemented in tandem. As for the transport of tracers based on discrete
velocity data, mentioned in~\cref{sec:general_remarks}, the interaction
between strain eigendirection interpolation method, and strainline integration
method, seems like an interesting research topic for potential future endeavors.
