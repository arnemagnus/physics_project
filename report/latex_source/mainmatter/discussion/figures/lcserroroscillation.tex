    {A possible explanation for the relatively large, constant constribution to
        the $\rmsd$ of the computed LCS curves for some of the high-accuracy
        cases. The computed LCS curves obtained by
        means of the Dormand-Prince 8(7) method, for tolerance levels
        $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-5}$ through to $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-8}$, are shown
        (solid) together with the reference LCS (dashed) for a subset of the
        computational domain $\mathcal{U}$. Notice how the second reference LCS
        curve segment (counting from the top and downwards) is present in the LCS
        approximations obtained for $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-5}$ and
        $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-7}$, but \emph{not} for $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-6}$
        and $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-8}$. The offset between the between the two
        topmost reference LCS curve segments shown in the figure is too small for the
        absence of the second topmost reference LCS curve segment to be flagged as a
        false negative. For all numerical step lengths and tolerance levels which
        correspond to the same level of $\rmsd$ in the computed LCS curves
        (see~\cref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_fixed,fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_both,%
        fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_fixed,fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_both}), the second topmost reference
        LCS curve segment is not present in the LCS approximation. For those cases,
        the offset between the analogue to the topmost one shown in this figure, and
        the second topmost reference LCS curve segment is approximately constant, and
        likely dominates any other errors --- which leads to the oscillation between
        a large, apparently constant error and the very small error observed for some
        cases, apparent in~\cref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_fixed,fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_both,%
    fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_fixed,fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_both}.}
