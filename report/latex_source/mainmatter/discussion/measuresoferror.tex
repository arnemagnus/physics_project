\section{About the measures of error}
\label{sec:about_the_measures_of_error}

For all the measures of error introduced in~\cref{sec:estimation_of_errors},
except the one concerning false positives and negatives with regards to
LCS identification, a sort of averaging was utilized. Regarding the flow maps,
this choice was made based on the fact that it encapsulates the effect of
outliers, that is, any tracers for which the advection error becomes
relatively large. These are expected to have the most severe impact on the
ensuing LCS identification procedure. As shown in
\cref{fig:flowmap_err_fixed,fig:flowmap_err_both}, the errors of the Euler
method and all of the adaptive stepsize methods, for the largest numerical step
length and tolerance level, respectively, are of order 1, similar to the
dimensions of the computational domain, that is,
$[0\hspace{1ex}2]\times[0\hspace{1ex}1]$. However, because there is no general
a priori way of knowing the regions of the domain in which the flow maps will be
resolved the most poorly, the maximum error is not of particular interest
in this kind of analysis.

Because the normal component of the velocity field is zero at the domain
boundaries, one expects the flow map error to, in some sense, be limited from
above by the domain extent. Thus, one could argue that using the median error
as the measure in such cases would be more appropriate. This is clearly an
artifact of the particular velocity field, however. For a generic compressible
system, this need not be the case. For reasons of consistency, in addition to
the inclusion of the error of outliers, the $\rmsd$ was used as the measure of
error for all flow maps. Similar arguments apply for the other measures
of errors involving $\rmsd$. Moreover, each particular kind of error
is expected to follow some sort of statistical distribution. Although the
exact natures of the distribution have not been explored in detail in this
project, because the tracers are advected independently, each error in
the flow maps, for instance, can be considered as an independent
random variable. Because of the large numbers of individual data samples,
the $\rmsd$ can be considered a measure of the standard deviation of the
distribution of errors as a whole.

While one could argue that using \emph{relative} errors with regards to
the strain eigenvalues would be more applicable, the fact that several
$\lambda_{1}$ values were close to zero would result in the errors being
misleadingly large. As a consequencem the relative errors in the
$\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ fields would scale differently, which would,
again, be deceptive. In addition, because the azimuthal angles of the strain
eigenvectors are calculated relative to what is really an arbitrary axis,
as far as the overall flow patterns are concerned, the \emph{absolute} errors
regarding the strain eigendirections is the only sensible measure. So, besides
the issues arising for small $\lambda_{1}$ values, the use of $\rmsd$ for
the eigenvalues was made for reasons of consistency.

Lastly, regarding the estimation of the offset of false positive and false
negative LCS curve segments, there certainly exists other relevant measures.
An important aspect of any such principle, however, is the elimination of
subjective assessment, for instance, one should not have to identify
what LCS curve segment a false positive most closely resembles by means of
inspection. Furthermore, the offset of false positives and negatives is not
an independent error measure --- it depends intrinsically on the errors
in the strain eigenvalue and eigenvector fields. As such, an interesting
approach could be to consider the entire set of computed strainlines, employing
some means of identifying the curve segments which resemble the reference
LCS curves the most, and examining the reason for which any false negatives
are eliminated, or why any false positives are included, in the final picture.
This sort of approach could provide useful insight into the nature of LCSs, but
was ultimately not pursued in this project, as it simply fell outside the
overall scope of this project, that is, the dependence of LCSs on the
underlying numerical integration scheme.
