Regarding my own future work, I find the prospect of analyzing
LCSs in three-dimensional flow systems alluring. To my knowledge, the
three-dimensional formulation of the variational LCS approach has not yet
been explored in detail in the literature. Thus, this could potentially
accelerate the recommendability of the use of LCS theory to describe systems
which can not reasonably be regarded as two-dimensional. Moreover, I think
that it would be natural to continue working on LCSs, considering that I have
developed a good understanding of the underlying physical principles through the
work I have conducted so far --- not to mention the fact that I have become
quite adept regarding the use of supercomputers for scientific purposes, which
I most certainly expect will become necessary, in view of the added inherent
mathematical complexity that follows by moving from two to three spatial
dimensions.
