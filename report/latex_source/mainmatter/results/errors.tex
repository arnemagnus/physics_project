\section{Measures of error}
\label{sec:measures_of_error}

Here, the measures of error introduced in~\cref{sec:estimation_of_errors} for
the different numerical integration schemes considered, are presented. For
each different type of error, two figures are included. One in which the error
of the singlestep methods is shown as a function of the integration step length,
and one in which the error of \emph{all} the integration methods is shown
as a function of the number of times right hand side of the ordinary
differential equation system, that is, the velocity field given by
\cref{eq:doublegyre}, was evaluated for each step length or tolerance level.
The reason for which only the singlestep errors are included in the first set of
figures, is that they are the only methods where the error is expected to scale
as a power of $h$, per \cref{def:rungekuttaorder}. This is naturally not the
case for the adaptive stepsize methods, where the step length varies.

More pertinent information can be found in the second set of figures, where
a well-suited integration method is characterized by generating small
errors at a small cost in terms of the required number of function calls,
in this case, the number of times the velocity field had to be evaluated.
Unlike the singlestep integrators, the advection of each tracer by means
of an adaptive stepsize method in principle requires a different number of
integration steps, and thus function evaluations. Thus, the presented number of
function evaluations is the \emph{average} across all of the advected tracers,
including the number of evaluations associated with rejected trial integration
steps. The number of function evaluations for each step of the considered
Runge-Kutta methods can be found as the number of rows in the Runge-Kutta
matrices of
