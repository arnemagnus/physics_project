\subsection{Computed deviations in the flow maps}
\label{sub:computed_deviations_in_the_flow_maps}
Figure~\ref{fig:flowmap_err_fixed} indicates that the $\rmsd$ of the flow maps,
as defined in equation~\eqref{eq:rmsdflowmap} follow the expected power laws
of the numerical errors for the various singlestep integrators. This is
as expected, because the flow maps are found by direct application of the
numerical integrators. In addition, the flow map $\rmsd$ seem to exhibit
boundedness from below by the counteracting accumulated floating-point
arithmetic error, as hypothesized in
\cref{sub:on_the_choice_of_numerical_step_lengths_and_tolerance_levels}.
This effect is most prominent in the error curves of the Kutta and
classical Runge-Kutta schemes, which in fact \emph{decrease} as a function
of the step length until $h=10^{-4}$ and $h=10^{-3}$, respectively. Based on
this evidence, the chosen step lengths appear to be appropriate.
%Although neither the $\rmsd$ of the Euler scheme nor that of the Heun scheme ever
%decreases as the step length increases, the trends nevertheless indicate that
%there would not be much to gain in terms of accuracy before the accumulated
%flating-point errors outweigh the inherent precisions of the two schemes.

Figure~\ref{fig:flowmap_err_both} indicates that a peak in numerical accuracy
did not materialize for the adaptive stepsize methods, for the considered
numerical tolerance levels. The figure also reveals that the Bogacki-Shampine
3(2) scheme is `cheap' when only a very crude approximation of the flow map is
needed; in particular, the aforementioned scheme requires less function
evaluations than even the Dormand-Prince 8(7) method for $\rmsd$s upwards of
$10^{-1}$. However, for smaller $\rmsd$ values, the Bogacki-Shampine 3(2)
scheme falls inbetween the Heun and Kutta schemes, which is to be expected,
seeing as the latter methods are of \nth{2} and \nth{3} order, respectively.
Notably, the Bogacki-Shampine 5(4) scheme is able to keep up with the
Dormand-Prince 8(7) method regarding efficiency, until approximately $600$
function evaluations. This complies with the notion that the Bogacki-Shampine
5(4) method practically behaves as an even higher order method, as mentioned in
\cref{sub:the_runge_kutta_methods_under_consideration}.
There does not seem to be a direct correspondence between the
$\rmsd$ of the flow maps, and that of the computed LCS curves, which will be
presented in~\cref{sub:computed_deviations_in_the_lcs_curves} --- which seems
reasonable, given that a lot of computations separate the flow maps from the
resulting LCS curves, as outlined in~\cref{cha:method}.
