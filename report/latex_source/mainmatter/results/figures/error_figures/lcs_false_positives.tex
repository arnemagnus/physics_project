    {Offset of the LCS curve segments identified as false positives as a
        function of the required number of function evaluations. The
        integration schemes for which no points are visible, yielded
        no false positives. For the adaptive stepsize methods, the
        \emph{average} number of function evaluations across all of the advected
    tracers is used as the metric.}
