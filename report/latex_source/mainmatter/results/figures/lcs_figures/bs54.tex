        LCS curves found by means of the Bogacki-Shampine 5(4) integration
        scheme. The reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure
        \ref{fig:referencelcs}, is dashed on the top layer. Note that
        the LCS for the lowest tolerance level considered, that is,
        $\textnormal{tol}=0.1$, is not included. This is because the
        corresponding $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domain, shown in figure
        \ref{fig:u0_dom_err_bs54}, and the reference $\mathcal{U}_{0}$, shown
        in figure~\ref{fig:u0_domain} are very dissimilar. Here, there are visible
        discrepancies for all tolerance levels $\textnormal{tol}>10^{-6}$.
        These are prominent all over the domain.}
