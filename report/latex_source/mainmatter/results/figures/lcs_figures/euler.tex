        LCS curves found by means of the Euler integration scheme. The
        reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure~\ref{fig:referencelcs},
        is plotted on the bottom layer. There is a clearly visible offset
        compared to the reference, for all but the two smallest numerical step
        lengths considered.}
