        LCS curves found by means of the Euler integration scheme. The
        reference LCS, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:referencelcs},
        is dashed on the top layer. There is a clearly visible offset
        compared to the reference, for all but the two smallest numerical step
        lengths considered. The two latter LCS curves appear to conform well.}
