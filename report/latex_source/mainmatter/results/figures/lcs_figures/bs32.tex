        LCS curves found by means of the Bogacki-Shampine 3(2) integration
        scheme. The reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure
        \ref{fig:referencelcs}, is dashed on the top layer. Note that
        the LCS for the lowest tolerance level considered, that is,
        $\textnormal{tol}=0.1$,
        is not included. This is because the corresponding $\mathcal{U}_{0}$
        domain, shown in figure~\ref{fig:u0_dom_err_bs32}, and the reference
        $\mathcal{U}_{0}$, shown in figure~\ref{fig:u0_domain} are nothing
        alike. The second lowest tolerance level, i.e., $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-2}$,
        is the main culprit, as far as discrepancies are concerned.}
