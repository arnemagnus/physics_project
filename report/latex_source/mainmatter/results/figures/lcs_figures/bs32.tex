        LCS curves found by means of the Bogacki-Shampine 3(2) integration
        scheme. The reference LCS, as shown in figure
        \ref{fig:referencelcs}, is dashed on the top layer. Note that
        the LCS for the lowest tolerance level considered, that is,
        $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-1}$,
        is not included. This is because the corresponding $\mathcal{U}_{0}$
        domain, shown in~\cref{fig:u0_dom_err_bs32}, and the reference
        $\mathcal{U}_{0}$, shown in~\cref{fig:u0_domain} are very
        dissimilar. The second lowest tolerance level, i.e., $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-2}$,
        is the main culprit among the remaining, as far as discrepancies are
    concerned.}
