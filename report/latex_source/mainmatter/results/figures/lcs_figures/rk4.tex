        LCS curves found by means of the classical Runge-Kutta integration scheme. The
        reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure~\ref{fig:referencelcs},
        is plotted on the bottom layer. The only visible discrepancy belongs
        to the second largest numerical time step length considered, and is
        located in the lower left corner.}
