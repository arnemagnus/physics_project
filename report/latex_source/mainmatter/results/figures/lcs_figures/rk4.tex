        LCS curves found by means of the classical Runge-Kutta integration scheme. The
        reference LCS, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:referencelcs},
        is dashed on the top layer. One of the very few visible
        discrepancies belongs to the second largest numerical time step length
        considered, and is located in the lower left corner.}
