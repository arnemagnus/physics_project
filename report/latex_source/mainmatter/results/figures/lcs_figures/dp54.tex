        LCS curves found by means of the Dormand-Prince 5(4) integration
        scheme. The reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure
        \ref{fig:referencelcs}, is plotted on the bottom layer. Note that
        the LCS for the lowest tolerance level considered, that is,
        $\textnormal{tol}=0.1$, is not included. This is because the
        corresponding $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domain, shown in figure
        \ref{fig:u0_dp54}, and the reference $\mathcal{U}_{0}$, shown in figure
        \ref{fig:u0_domain} are dissimilar. Here, there are visible
        disparities for for all tolerance levels $\textnormal{tol}>10^{-6}$.}
