        LCS curves found by means of the Kutta integration scheme. The
        reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure~\ref{fig:referencelcs},
        is plotted on the bottom layer. There are visible disparities with
        regards to the reference both for the smallest and the largest numerical
        time step lengths considered.}
