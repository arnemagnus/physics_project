        LCS curves found by means of the Kutta integration scheme. The
        reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure~\ref{fig:referencelcs},
        is dashed on the top layer. There are some disparities with
        regards to the reference both for the two largest numerical
        time step lengths considered. These are most pronounced in the lower
        left corner, near the leftmost `U' shape by $y=0.4$ and the `$\cap$'
        shape near $x=1.25$.}
