        LCS curves found by means of the Kutta integration scheme. The
        reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure~\ref{fig:referencelcs},
        is plotted on the bottom layer. There are some disparities with
        regards to the reference both for the smallest and the largest numerical
        time step lengths considered. These are most pronounced in the lower
        left corner, and near the leftmost `U' shape by $y=0.4$.}
