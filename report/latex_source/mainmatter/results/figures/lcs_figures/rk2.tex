        LCS curves found by means of the Heun integration scheme. The
        reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure~\ref{fig:referencelcs},
        is plotted on the bottom layer. There exists discrepancies with
        regards to the reference for the two largest numerical time step
        lengths considered. These are most prominent in the lower left corner,
        and near $x=1$.}
