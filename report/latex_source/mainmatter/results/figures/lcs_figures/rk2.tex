        LCS curves found by means of the Heun integration scheme. The
        reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure~\ref{fig:referencelcs},
        is plotted on the bottom layer. There are clear discrepancies with
        regards to the reference for the two largest numerical time step
        lengths considered.}
