        LCS curves found by means of the Dormand-Prince 8(7) integration
        scheme. The reference LCS, as shown by itself in figure
        \ref{fig:referencelcs}, is plotted on the bottom layer. Note that
        the LCS for the lowest tolerance level considered, that is,
        $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-1}$, is not included. This is because the
        corresponding $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domain, shown in figure
        \ref{fig:u0_dom_err_dp87}, and the reference $\mathcal{U}_{0}$, shown in figure
        \ref{fig:u0_domain} are unlike one another. Here, the most immediately
        discernible dissimilarities emanate from the tolerance level
        $\textnormal{tol}=10^{-2}$. Close inspection, however, reveals
        discrepancies for all tolerance levels $\textnormal{tol}>10^{-6}$,
        particularly in the lower left corner.}
