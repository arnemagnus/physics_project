\subsection{Computed deviations in the strain eigenvalues and -vectors}
\label{sub:computed_deviations_in_the_strain_eigenvalues_and_vectors}

For brevity, only the $\rmsd$ of $\lambda_{2}$ and the direction of
$\vct{\xi}_{2}$, are included here. The latter is justified because of
the orthogonality of the eigenvectors of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor, which
means that the $\rmsd$ of the directions of both eigenvectors \emph{must} be
identical. As it turns out, the $\rmsd$ of $\lambda_{1}$ scales similarly to
that of $\lambda_{2}$, both as a function of numerical step length (for the
singlestep methods) and the number of function evaluations. Additionally, the
numerical reformulation of the existence theorem for hyperbolic LCSs, given in
equation~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence}, exhibits a more sensitive dependence to
$\lambda_{2}$ than $\lambda_{1}$. This is explicitly observable from
conditions~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence2} and~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence4},
and favors $\lambda_{2}$ as the most crucial eigenvalue.

Figure~\ref{fig:lmbd2_err_fixed} indicates that the $\rmsd$ of $\lambda_{2}$,
as defined in equation~\eqref{eq:rmsdlmbd}, follow the anticipated power law
of the numerical errors for the various singlestep integrators. Interestingly,
the $\rmsd$ dependence on the numerical steplength is completely analogous to
that of the $\rmsd$ of the flow maps, as presented in
\cref{sub:computed_deviations_in_the_flow_maps}. Furthermore, inspection of
figure~\ref{fig:lmbd2_err_both} reveals that the $\rmsd$ of the $\lambda_{2}$
scales similarly to the $\rmsd$ of the flow maps for all of the integration
schemes, differing only by a numerical prefactor. This does make sense
intuitively, seeing as the Cauchy-Green strain eigenvalues are computed by
means of the \emph{main} tracers, as described in
\cref{sec:calculating_the_cauchy_green_strain_tensor}.

Figure~\ref{fig:xi2_err_fixed} reveals that the $\rmsd$ of the eigenvector
direction, as defined in equation~\eqref{eq:rmsddirection}, is negligible for
all numerical step lengths. In fact, the numerical errors are comparable
to, or even smaller than, the inherent double-precision floating-point number
accuracy, which is of order $10^{-16}$. For this reason, the agreement with
the anticipated power laws should not be taken as any kind of conclusive
evidence. Figure~\ref{fig:xi2_err_both}, shows that this is in fact the case for
the adaptive stepsize methods too, aside from the tolerance level
$\textnormal{tol}=10^{-1}$, which corresponds to the fewest function evaluations
for each scheme. As has already been established in figure
\ref{fig:u0_dom_errs}, for that tolerance level, none of the integrators yield
$\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domains with reasonable degrees of resemblance to the
reference, which is shown in figure~\ref{fig:u0_domain}.

Aside from this tolerance level, though, the error in eigenvector direction
is comparable to, or smaller than, the floating-point accuracy. Thus, we may
conclude that the eigenvector directions are computed correctly for just about
any tolerance level and numerical time step length. This can be understood as a
consequence of the use of the auxiliary tracers in order to compute the strain
eigenvectors, as described in
\cref{sec:calculating_the_cauchy_green_strain_tensor}, which, by construction,
is more accurate than using the main tracers. Moreover, these results imply that
the error in the resulting LCS curves are driven just about entirely by
the error in the computed eigenvalues.
