Figure~\ref{fig:lcs_err_fixed} indicates that the $\rmsd$ of the LCS curves,
as defined in equation~\eqref{eq:rmsdlcs}, does not follow the expected power
laws of the numerical errors for the various singlestep integrators. The error
quickly flattens for all integrators except the Euler scheme, which agrees well
with the LCS curves presented in~\cref{fig:lcs_rk2,fig:lcs_rk3,fig:lcs_rk4},
where there are no visible discrepancies with regards to the reference LCS curve
for step lengths smaller than $10^{-2}$. Moreover, the fact that the $\rmsd$
of the curves obtained by means of the Euler method appears to have flattened
at a higher level than the rest of the integrators implies that the Euler
method will never result in LCS curves with similar degrees of accuracy
as for the other schemes.

Interestingly, a similar pattern is apparent in figure
\ref{fig:lcs_err_both}, in that, the $\rmsd$ of the higher-order methods
decreases steadily, until a certain point where it suddenly jumps to the same
steady level as the (high order) singlestep methods. The most reasonable
explanation is that when the number of function evaluations reaches some
threshold, the accumulated floating-point arithmetic errors gain a larger
influence than the inherent precision of the integrators. By similar logic, the
sudden drop in $\rmsd$ for the high order singlestep methods with numerical
step length $h=10^{-5}$, apparent in both
\cref{fig:lcs_err_fixed,fig:lcs_err_both}, seems to be an artifact of the random
nature of the accumulated floating-point errors, moreso than a sudden
re-manifestation of the inherent integrator accuracy.
