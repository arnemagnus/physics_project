\subsection{Computed deviations in the LCS curves}
\label{sub:computed_deviations_in_the_lcs_curves}

Figures~\ref{fig:lcs_err_fp_fp} and~\ref{fig:lcs_err_fn_fn} indicate that
the integrated offset of false positives and negatives, as defined in
\cref{eq:midpointfalselcs}, is a decreasing function of the number of
function evaluations for all integration schemes. Moreover, the issue of false
positives and negatives vanishes entirely for sufficiently many funcion
evaluations, that is, sufficiently small numerical step lengths or tolerance
levels. This conforms well with the visual representations of the various
approximations of the LCS curve, as shown in
\cref{sec:the_lcs_curves_obtained_using_the_different_schemes}, in addition
to providing an indication that the LCS present in the double gyre system is
robust.

Note that the offset of false positives and negatives has not been plotted as a function
of numerical time step, for the singlestep methods. As can be seen from figures
\ref{fig:lcs_err_fp_fp} and~\ref{fig:lcs_err_fn_fn}, only the Euler method
results in false positives or negatives for more than one of the considered
integration step lengths, meaning that there are simply too few data points
to identify correlations with the expected expected power laws of the numerical
errors as a function of the time step, cf.~\cref{def:rungekuttaorder}.
Furthermore, offsets for the adaptive stepsize methods are not included for the
tolerance level $10^{-1}$, because the LCS identification proved to be an
insurmountable task for those cases, as described in
\cref{sub:lcs_curves_stemming_from_adaptive_stepsize_methods}. However,
based on the associated $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domains, shown in figure
\ref{fig:u0_dom_errs}, one may infer an overwhelming probability of a large
number of false positives and negatives to be present, seeing as the underlying
strain systems are quite clearly different to the reference, shown in
figure~\ref{fig:u0_domain}.

Figures~\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_fixed} and~\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_fixed} indicate
that the $\rmsd$ of the LCS curves, as defined in~\cref{eq:rmsdlcs},
does not follow the expected scalings of the numerical errors with the
stepsize for the various singlestep integrators. Moreover, the two measures of
the $\rmsd$ show the same quantitative behaviour, which is to be expected. The
error quickly flattens for all integrators except the Euler scheme, which agrees
well with the LCS curves presented in
\cref{fig:lcs_rk2,fig:lcs_rk3,fig:lcs_rk4}, where there are no visible
discrepancies with regards to the reference LCS curve for step lengths smaller
than $10^{-2}$. The fact that the $\rmsd$ of the curves obtained
by means of the Euler method appears to have flattened at a higher level than
the rest of the integrators implies that the Euler method will never result in
LCS curves with similar degrees of accuracy as for the other schemes. Lastly,
the sudden drop in $\rmsd$ for the other methods for the transition
$h=10^{-4}\rightarrow{h=10^{-5}}$ is unexpected. There is no clear reason for
why it occurs. A similar effect is not present in the $\rmsd$s of the
flow map, eigenvalues nor eigenvectors, shown in figures
\cref{fig:flowmap_err_fixed,fig:lmbd2_err_fixed,fig:xi2_err_fixed}.

\input{mainmatter/results/figures/error_figures/lcs_fp_nn_error_fixed_steplength.tex}

Figures~\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_both} and~\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_both}
show the $\rmsd$ of the LCS curves for all numerical integration methods as a
function of the required number of function evaluations per advected tracer.
For the adaptive stepsize methods, the error decreases steadily
with the number of function evaluations until a certain point, after which
the error suddently jumps to the same steady level as the (high order)
singlestep methods. Like the sudden drop in the error for the singlestep
methods with a large number of function evaluations (i.e., for sufficiently
small time steps), there is no obvious reason why this jump occurs, as a similar
trend is not found in the $\rmsd$s of the flow map, eigenvalues nor eigenvectors,
as shown in
\cref{fig:flowmap_err_both,fig:lmbd2_err_both,fig:xi2_err_both}. Finally,
\cref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_both,fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_both} suggest that the
Bogacki-Shampine 5(4) and Dormand-Prince 8(7) schemes provide the overall most
efficient means of obtaining accurate LCS curves for the considered double gyre
system, in terms of the number of function evaluations needed to reach a given
level of precision.

%
%
%\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_both} and~\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_both}, in that, the
%$\rmsd$ of the higher-order methods decreases steadily, until a certain point
%where it suddenly jumps to the same steady level as the (high order) singlestep
%methods. The most reasonable explanation is that when the number of function
%evaluations reaches some threshold, the accumulated floating-point arithmetic
%errors gain a larger influence than the inherent precision of the integrators.
%By similar logic, the sudden drop in $\rmsd$ for the high order singlestep
%methods with numerical step length $h=10^{-5}$, as can be seen in
%\cref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_fixed,fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_fixed}, is most likely an
%artifact of the random nature of the accumulated floating-point errors,
%moreso than a sudden `re-manifestation' of the inherent integrator accuracy.
%Finally, \cref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_both,fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_both} suggests that
%the high order adaptive stepsize methods, namely the Bogacki-Shampine 5(4) and
%Dormand-Prince 8(7) schemes, provide the most efficient means of obtaining
%accurate LCS curves for the considered double gyre system.
