\subsection{Computed deviations in the LCS curves}
\label{sub:computed_deviations_in_the_lcs_curves}

Figures~\ref{fig:lcs_err_fp_fp} and~\ref{fig:lcs_err_fn_fn} indicate that
the offset of false positives and negatives, as defined in equation
\eqref{eq:midpointfalselcs}, is a decreasing function of the number of
function evaluations for all integration schemes. Moreover, the issue of false
positives and negatives vanishes entirely for sufficiently many funcion
evaluations, that is, sufficiently small numerical step lengths or tolerance
levels. This conforms well with the visual representations of the various
approximations of the LCS curve, as shown in
\cref{sec:the_lcs_curves_obtained_using_the_different_schemes}, aside from
providing an indication that that the LCS present in the double gyre system is
robust.

Note that the offset of false positives and negatives has not been plotted as a function
of numerical time step, for the singlestep methods. As can be seen from figures
\ref{fig:lcs_err_fp_fp} and~\ref{fig:lcs_err_fn_fn}, only the Euler method
results in false positives or negatives for more than one of the considered
integration step lengths, meaning that there are simply too few data points
to identify correlations with the expected expected power laws of the numerical
errors as a function of the time step, cf.~\cref{def:rungekuttaorder}.
Furthermore, offsets for the adaptive stepsize methods are not included for the
tolerance level $10^{-1}$, because the LCS identification proved to be an
insurmountable task for those cases, as described in
\cref{sub:lcs_curves_stemming_from_adaptive_stepsize_methods}. However,
based on the associated $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domains, shown in figure
\ref{fig:u0_dom_errs}, one may infer an overwhelming probability of a large
number of false positives and negatives to be present, seeing as the underlying
strain systems are quite clearly different to the reference, shown in
figure~\ref{fig:u0_domain}.

Figures~\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_fixed} and~\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_fixed} indicate
that the $\rmsd$ of the LCS curves, as defined in equation~\eqref{eq:rmsdlcs},
does not follow the expected power laws of the numerical errors for the various
singlestep integrators. Moreover, the two measures of the $\rmsd$ show the
same quantitative behaviour, which is to be expected. The error quickly flattens
for all integrators except the Euler scheme, which agrees well with the LCS
curves presented in~\cref{fig:lcs_rk2,fig:lcs_rk3,fig:lcs_rk4},
where there are no visible discrepancies with regards to the reference LCS curve
for step lengths smaller than $10^{-2}$. In addition, the fact that the $\rmsd$
of the curves obtained by means of the Euler method appears to have flattened
at a higher level than the rest of the integrators implies that the Euler
method will never result in LCS curves with similar degrees of accuracy
as for the other schemes.

\input{mainmatter/results/figures/error_figures/lcs_fp_nn_error_both.tex}

\input{mainmatter/results/figures/error_figures/lcs_fn_nn_error_both.tex}

Interestingly, a similar pattern is apparent from figures
\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_both} and~\ref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_both}, in that, the
$\rmsd$ of the higher-order methods decreases steadily, until a certain point
where it suddenly jumps to the same steady level as the (high order) singlestep
methods. The most reasonable explanation is that when the number of function
evaluations reaches some threshold, the accumulated floating-point arithmetic
errors gain a larger influence than the inherent precision of the integrators.
By similar logic, the sudden drop in $\rmsd$ for the high order singlestep
methods with numerical step length $h=10^{-5}$, as can be seen in
\cref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_fixed,fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_fixed}, is most likely an
artifact of the random nature of the accumulated floating-point errors,
moreso than a sudden `re-manifestation' of the inherent integrator accuracy.
Finally, \cref{fig:lcs_rmsd_fp_nn_both,fig:lcs_rmsd_fn_nn_both} suggests that
the high order adaptive stepsize methods, namely the Bogacki-Shampine 5(4) and
Dormand-Prince 8(7) schemes, provide the most efficient means of obtaining
accurate LCS curves for the considered double gyre system.
