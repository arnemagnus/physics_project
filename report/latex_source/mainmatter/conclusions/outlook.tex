\subsubsection{Suggestions for further work}

A plethora of numerical integration methods were not tested as a part of this
project. An entirely different class of ODE solvers to the ones considered here,
namely linear multistep methods, could have various desirable properties. In
particular, methods of this kind have memory. They take the velocities at
previous steps into account, which results in fewer velocity field evaluations
being necessary. If the velocity field is computationally expensive to evaluate,
the use of multistep methods opens up the possibility of using smaller numerical
step lengths than for singlestep methods without sacrificing computation time.
In short, multistep methods function quite differently to the memoryless
solvers considered here. Interestingly, both fixed and adaptive stepsize linear
multistep methods exist, and, by means of known recurrence relations, one may in
principle design multistep methods of arbitrary order
\parencite[chapter III]{hairer1993solving}. Research with regards to the
usefulness of such methods in the context of LCS detection --- in addition to
investigations on robust, numerical implementation of the as yet somewhat
ambiguous LCS existence condition regarding the identification of the locally
most repelling strainlines --- could reasonably be conducted based upon
the double gyre system examined in this project.
%Investigations regarding a robust, numerical implementation of one of the
%LCS existence conditions could also be conducted based upon the double gyre
%system considered here.

For my own future work, I think that it would be natural to continue
the study of LCSs. In particular, I find the prospect of analyzing LCSs in
three-dimensional flow systems alluring. To my knowledge, the three-dimensional
formulation of the variational LCS approach has not yet been explored in the
literature. Thus, this could potentially accelerate the recommendability of
the use of LCS theory to describe systems which can not reasonably be regarded
as two-dimensional. Moreover, examining a broader range of systems seems like
a logical extension of the work I have conducted as part of this project.
Lastly, as suggested previously, investigations with regards to the interaction
between numerical integration and interpolation schemes in the context of LCS
detection are appealing, due to their innate relation to real-world
applications.

%Furthermore, under the assumption that I am able to
%find a three-dimensional velocity field for which there exists a plane with a
%similar double gyre field to the one which has been investigated in detail in
%relation to this project, the results obtained here could prove useful
%with regards to verification.

%Moreover, there are a myriad of integration methods which were not investigated
%here. Aside from the many singlestep and embedded methods, there also exists
%an entirely different class of ODE solvers; namely, linear multistep methods.
%These methods have memory, and thus function quite differently from the
%ones considered for this project. Interestingly, both fixed and adaptive
%stepsize linear multistep methods exist, and, by means of known recurrence
%relations, one may in principle design multistep methods of arbitrary order
%\parencite[chapter III]{hairer1993solving}. A study of linear multistep
%integration methods can be viewed as a natural extension to the study of LCSs
%in three-dimensional flows, as suggested above.
