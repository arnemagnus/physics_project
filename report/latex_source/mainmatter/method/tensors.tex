\section{Calculating the Cauchy-Green strain tensor}
\label{sec:calculating_the_cauchy_green_strain_tensor}

Making use of the auxiliary tracer points, as outlined in
\cref{sub:generating_a_set_of_initial_conditions}, the Jacobian of the flow
map was approximated by means of centered differences as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:auxjacobian}
    \vct{\nabla}\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}) \approx%
    \begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}^{r})%
        -\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}^{l})}{2\delta{}x} &
        \dfrac{\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}^{u})%
        -\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}^{l})}{2\delta{}y}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The Cauchy-Green strain tensor was then calculated as per
\cref{eq:cauchygreen}. \textcite{farazmand2012computing} bring up the point
that using only the auxiliary tracers in the calculation of the eigenvalues and
-vectors of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor is not sufficient for measuring the
amount of local repulsion or attraction of the material lines. Their
justification is that the set of auxiliary tracers around a main tracer
$\vct{x}_{i,j}$ tends to stay on the same side of an LCS due to the small
initial separations $\delta{}x$ and $\delta{}y$, resulting in the auxiliary
tracers undergoing less stretching than the main tracers which lay on opposite
sides of repelling LCSs. Thus, the magnitudes of eigen\emph{values} stemming
from finite differencing applied to the auxiliary tracers are generally
underestimated. On the other hand, the eigen\emph{vectors} are computed
more accurately than they would be by use of the main tracers alone.

Because of the tendency of finite differencing applied to the auxiliary tracers
to underestimate the magnitudes of the eigenvalues, an approximation of the
Jacobian of the flow map was also made by means of applying centered
differencing to the main tracers, as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mainjacobian}
    \widetilde{\vct{\nabla}\vct{F}}\hspace{0ex}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}) \approx%
    \begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i+1,j})%
        -\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i-1,j})}{2\Delta{}x} &
        \dfrac{\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j+1})%
        -\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j-1})}{2\Delta{}y}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The extended grid, as outlined in
\cref{sub:generating_a_set_of_initial_conditions}, allowed for a consistent
centered differencing approximation for all the main tracers, including the
first set of extended rows and columns, where the latter play an important
role in the analysis to follow --- more on that in
\cref{sec:identifying_lcs_candidates_numerically}. The numerical approximation
of the eigen\emph{values} of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor were thus calculated
by means of the main tracers, using~\cref{eq:mainjacobian}, while
the approximation of the corresponding eigen\emph{vectors} were calculated by
means of the auxiliary tracers, that is, using~\cref{eq:auxjacobian}.
