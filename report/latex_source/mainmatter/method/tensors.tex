\section{Calculating the Cauchy-Green strain tensor}
\label{sec:calculating_the_cauchy_green_strain_tensor}

Making use of the auxiliary tracer points, as outlined in
\cref{sub:generating_a_set_of_initial_conditions}, the Jacobian of the flow
map was approximated by means of centered differences as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:auxjacobian}
    \vct{\nabla}\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}) \approx%
    \begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}^{r})%
        -\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}^{l})}{2\delta{}x} &
        \dfrac{\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}^{u})%
        -\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}^{l})}{2\delta{}y}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

The Cauchy-Green strain tensor was then calculated as per equation
\eqref{eq:cauchygreen}. \textcite{farazmand2012computing} bring up the point
that using only the auxiliary tracers in the calculation of the eigenvalues and
-vectors of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor is not sufficient for measuring the
amount of local repulsion or attraction of the material lines. Their
justification is that the set of auxiliary tracers around a main tracer
$\vct{x}_{i,j}$ tends to stay on the same side of a LCS due to the small
initial separations $\delta{}x$ and $\delta{}y$, resulting in the auxiliary
tracers undergoing less stretching than the main tracers which lay on opposite
sides of repelling LCSs.

For this reason, an approximation of the Jacobian of the flow map was also
made by means of applying centered differencing to the main tracers, as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mainjacobian}
    \widetilde{\vct{\nabla}\vct{F}}\hspace{0ex}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j}) \approx%
    \begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i+1,j})%
        -\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i-1,j})}{2\Delta{}x} &
        \dfrac{\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j+1})%
        -\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{i,j-1})}{2\Delta{}y}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

The artificial grid extension, as outlined in
\cref{sub:generating_a_set_of_initial_conditions}, allowed for a consistent
centered differencing approximation for all the main tracers, including the
first set of extended rows and columns, where the latter play an important
role in the analysis to follow --- more on that in
\cref{sec:identifying_lcs_candidates_numerically}. The numerical approximation
of the eigen\emph{values} of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor were thus calculated
by means of the main tracers, equation~\eqref{eq:mainjacobian}, while
the approximation of the corresponding eigen\emph{vectors} were calculated by
means of the auxiliary tracers, equation~\eqref{eq:auxjacobian}.
