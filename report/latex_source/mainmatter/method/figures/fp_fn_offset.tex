    {Illustration of how the offset of false LCS segments was computed.
        A segment of the reference LCS is denoted $\gamma$. Two segments of
        an LCS approximation are denoted $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$ and
        $\widehat{\gamma}_{0}$, respectively. Any LCS segment which is further
        away from each reference LCS curve segment than a pre-set length
        $l_{\textnormal{noise}}=0.01$ are labelled as false positives.
        In the figure, the borders offset this region surrounding $\gamma$
        are indicated by dashed lines. Accordingly, $\widehat{\gamma}_{0}$ is
        recognized as a false positive in the above figure. Then, the shaded
        area $\mathcal{A}$ between the reference LCS and the curve segments
        identified as false positives is estimated by means of the midpoint rule.
        That is, for each point on a false positive segment of the approximated
        LCS, the smallest distance separating it and the reference is weighted
        with $\Delta$, the step length used in the numerical integration of
        strainlines. Because the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$-field is normalized to unit
        length, $\Delta$ equals the distance between consecutive points in
        the parametrizations of both the approximated and the reference LCS
        curves, per the definition of the fictitious time-like coordinate $s$
        in~\cref{eq:strainlineode}. In the case of false negatives,
        no LCS curve segments fall within $l_{\textnormal{noise}}$, in which
        case $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the minimal area between the reference
        LCS curve and the approximated LCS curve, for each point of the
        reference LCS segment which is not found in the approximation.
        In the figure, this would correspond to the absence of
        $\widetilde{\gamma}_{0}$, if $\widehat{\gamma}_{0}$ was then the
    part of the LCS approximation closest to $\gamma$.}
