    \caption[The identification process of strainlines which
    are local strain maximizers]{Illustration of the identification process of
        strainlines which are local strain maximizers.
        Local maxima of $\overline{\lambda}_{2}(\gamma)$, the average of
        $\lambda_{2}$ over a curve $\gamma$, are found along a set $\mathcal{L}$
        of horizontal and vertical lines. The strainline segment
    $\gamma_{0}$ is identified as a local maximizer if it contains a locally
maximal $\overline{\lambda}_{2}$ value along at least one of the lines in
$\mathcal{L}$. The dashed ellipses indicate the regions outside which
adjacent intersections are excluded from the local maximization process.
The half-width of the ellipses is given as a pre-select threshold
$l_{\textnormal{nb}}=0.2$. Intersections of sufficiently close strainlines,
that is, strainlines whose intersection(s) fall within the dashed
ellipses, are included in the local comparison process for a given intersection
between a line in $\mathcal{L}$ and the strainline segment $\gamma_{0}$.}
