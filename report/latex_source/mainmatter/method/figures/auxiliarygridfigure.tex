    {Illustration of the concept of auxiliary tracers,. These were introduced
        to increase the accuracy with which the Jacobian of the flow map,
        and by extension the Cauchy-Green strain tensor field (given by
        \cref{eq:cauchygreen}), was computed. Grey blobs represent the original
        tracers, whereas white blobs
        represent the auxiliary ones.}
