    {Illustration of the concept of auxilary tracers, used in order to
    compute the Jacobian of the flow map, and by extension, the Cauchy-Green
    strain tensor field, cf.\ equation~\eqref{eq:cauchygreen}, more accurately.
    Grey blobs represent the original tracers, whereas white blobs represent
    the auxiliary ones.}
