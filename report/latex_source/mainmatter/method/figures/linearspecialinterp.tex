    {Illustration of the special-purpose linear interpolation used to compute
        trajectories of the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$ eigenvector field. At point
        \textbf{(a)}, there is an orientational discontinuity at the lower
        right grid point, which is corrected by rotating the corresponding
        vector by $180\si{\degree}$ prior to linear interpolation. At point
        \textbf{(b)}, there is no orientational discontinuity. Lastly,
        at point \textbf{(c)}, the interpolated vector must be flipped due
    to the overall orientation of the trajectory.}
