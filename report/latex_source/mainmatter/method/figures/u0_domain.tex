    \caption[The set $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ for the double gyre system, and the
    reduced set of strain initial conditions]{The set
        $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ for the double gyre system, given by
    \cref{eq:doublegyre,eq:doublegyrefuns,eq:doublegyreparams}, is shown at the
    top. This is the set of initial conditions where the LCS existence
    conditions given in \cref{eq:numericalexistence1,eq:numericalexistence2}
    are satisfied.  Its intersection with a set of four horizontal and four
    vertical, equidistant lines is shown at the bottom. The latter was used as
    the set of strain initial conditions, in order to eliminate (or at least,
    reduce the amount of) redundant computations of strainlines within
$\mathcal{U}_{0}$.}
