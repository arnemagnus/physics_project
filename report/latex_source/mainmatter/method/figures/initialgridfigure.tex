                Dark grey blobs signify the principal tracers, i.e., the tracers
                which discretize the computational domain
            $[0\hspace{1ex}2]\times[0\hspace{1ex}1]$. These were equidistantly
        spaced in either direction, with twice as many points in the $x$-
        direction as the $y$-direction, in order to generate an approximately
        equidistant grid. Together with the principal grid, the light grey
        blobs, i.e., tracers originating outside of the computational domain,
        constitute the extended grid. This extension was made in order to
        properly encapsulate the dynamics at the domain boundaries, in the
    analysis to follow.}
