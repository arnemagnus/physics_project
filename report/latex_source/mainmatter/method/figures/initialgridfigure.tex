                Dark grey blobs signify the main tracers, i.e., the tracers
                which discretize the computational domain
            $[0\hspace{1ex}2]\times[0\hspace{1ex}1]$. These were linearly
        spaced in either direction, with twice as many points in the $x$-
        direction as the $y$-direction, in order to generate an approximately
        equidistant grid. Light grey blobs
        signify the artificially extended grid, i.e., tracers starting
        originating outside of the computational domain. These were used in
        order to properly encapsulate the dynamics at the domain boundaries,
        in the analysis to follow.}
