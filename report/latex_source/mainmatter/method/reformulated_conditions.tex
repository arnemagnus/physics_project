\section{Identifying LCS candidates numerically}
\label{sec:identifying_lcs_candidates_numerically}

\textcite{farazmand2012computing} found the identification of the
zeros of the inner product in equation~\eqref{eq:lcsexistence4} of
\cref{thm:lcsexistence} to be numerically sensitive. For this reason, they
suggest a reformulated set of conditions which make for more robust numerical
implementation, as follows:
\vspace{\fill}


\begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:numericalexistence}
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:numericalexistence1}
        &\lambda_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})\neq\lambda_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})>1\\
        \label{eq:numericalexistence2}
        &\big\langle\vct{\xi}_{2}(\vct{x}_{0}),%
            \mtrx{H}_{\lambda_{2}}(\vct{x}_{0})%
            \vct{\xi}_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})\big\rangle \leq 0\\
        \label{eq:numericalexistence3}
        &\vct{\xi}_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})\parallel\mathcal{M}(t_{0})\\
        \label{eq:numericalexistence4}
        &\begin{gathered}
            \overline{\lambda}_{2},\ \textnormal{the average of}%
            \ \lambda_{2}\ \textnormal{over a curve}\ \gamma,\ %
            \textnormal{is maximal on}\ \mathcal{M}(t_{0})\\ %
            \hspace{-1.3em}\textnormal{among all}\ \textnormal{nearby curves}\ %
            \gamma\ \textnormal{satisfying}\ \gamma\parallel\vct{\xi}_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})
        \end{gathered}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The relaxation of condition~\eqref{eq:lcsexistence2} in~\cref{thm:lcsexistence}
from strict inequality to condition~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence2}, which
also allows equality, means that LCSs are allowed to have finite thickness.
However, the set of criteria given in equation ~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence}
enforce that all LCSs have uniquely defined local orientations. Conditions
\eqref{eq:lcsexistence3} and~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence3} are equivalent,
due to the orthogonality of the eigenvectors $\vct{\xi}_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})$ and
$\vct{\xi}_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})$, although the form~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence3}
turns out to be more advantageous for use in computations.

Because of the artificial extension of the main computational grid, as outlined
in \cref{sub:generating_a_set_of_initial_conditions}, the Cauchy-Green strain
tensor could be calculated for the innermost of the padded rows and columns
by means of the same centered difference methods as described in
\cref{sec:calculating_the_cauchy_green_strain_tensor}. Thus, a similar
centered differencing approach was used in order to approximate the Hessian
matrices of the set of eigenvalues $\lambda_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})$ for the tracers
in the entire computational domain.

\subsection{A framework for computing smooth strainlines}
\label{sub:a_framework_for_computing_smooth_strainlines}

Per condition~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence3}, hyperbolic LCSs are composed
of material curves tangent to the $\vct{\xi}_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})$ vector field,
i.e., the eigenvector field associated with the smaller eigenvalue field
$\lambda_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})$ of the Cauchy-Green strain tensor field
$\mtrx{C}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{0})$. The tensor lines tangent to the
$\vct{\xi}_{1}$-field will be referred to as \emph{strainlines}
in the following, a term coined by \textcite{farazmand2012computing}. Aside from
points within $\mathcal{U}$ which exhibit repeated eigenvalues and thus
oriental discontinuities in both eigenvector fields, strainlines can be computed
as smooth trajectories of the ordinary differential equation

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:strainlinebasicode}
\vct{r}'=\vct{\xi}_{1}(\vct{r}),\quad\vct{r}\in\mathcal{U},%
    \quad\norm{\vct{\xi}_{1}(\vct{r})}=1.
\end{equation}

As pointed out by \textcite{onu2015lcstool}, the orientational discontinuities
of the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$-field are removable, through careful monitoring and
local reorientation. This process can be described in terms of three steps.
First, the nearest neighboring grid points are identified. Then, oriental
discontinuities inbetween the grid elements are identified by inspecting the
inner product of the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$ vectors of adjacent grid points. Rotations
exceeding $90\si{\degree}$ between pairs of neighboring vectors are labelled
as oriental discontinuities, which are corrected prior to the linear
interpolation by flipping the corresponding vectors by $180\si{\degree}$.
In the end, linear interpolation is used within the grid element.

Furthermore, should the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$-vector obtained from the local
special-purpose linear interpolation outlined above prove to be rotated by more
than $90\si{\degree}$ relative to the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$-vector from the previous
level of pseudotime used in the numerical integration of system
\eqref{eq:strainlinebasicode}, it would be flipped $180\si{\degree}$, by
the same logic as in the special linear interpolation. The entire process
of the special-purpose local linear interpolation method is outlined in
figure \ref{fig:locallinearinterp}.

\input{mainmatter/method/figures/linearspecialinterp.tex}

So, in order to compute globally smooth strainlines, equation
\eqref{eq:strainlinebasicode} is altered in the following way:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:strainlineode}
    \vct{r}'(s)=\sgn\Big(\big\langle\vct{f}\big(\vct{r}(s)\big),%
    \vct{r}'(s-\Delta)\big\rangle\Big)\ \vct{f}\big(\vct{r}'(s)\big),
\end{equation}

where $\vct{f}$ denotes the special-purpose local linear interpolation of
the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$ field, as outlined above and in figure
\ref{fig:locallinearinterp}, $\Delta$ is the numerical step length
used in the numerical integration, while signum function is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:signumfunction}
\sgn(x)=\begin{cases}1,&\textnormal{for}\ x>0\\
        0,&\textnormal{for}\ x=0\\
        -1,&\textnormal{for}\ x<0\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Extracting hyperbolic LCSs from strainlines}
\label{sub:extracting_hyperbolic_lcss_from_strainlines}

If a material line $\mathcal{M}(t_{0})$ lies within a strainline, it
automatically fulfills condition~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence3}.
The segments of the strainlines on which the remaining conditions
\eqref{eq:numericalexistence1},~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence2} and
\eqref{eq:numericalexistence4} are satisfied comprises the set of hyperbolic
LCSs in the flow over time interval $[t_{0},t_{0}+T]$.
\textcite{farazmand2012computing} suggest that, in order to identify this
set of LCSs, one should start by identifying the subdomain
$\mathcal{U}_{0}\subset\mathcal{U}$ on which the conditions
\eqref{eq:numericalexistence1} and~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence2} are satisfied,
and then integrate the system given by equation~\eqref{eq:strainlineode} from
initial conditions within $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ to construct strainlines.
Generally, the integration proceeds until each strainline reaches the domain
boundaries of $\mathcal{U}$, or reaches a degenerate point of the original
$\vct{\xi}_{1}$ vector field.

Using all of the points in the $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domain would inevitably
involve computing a lot of strainlines several times over. In order to
reduce the number of redundant calculations, the set of considered strain
initial conditions were reduced, with the approach suggested by
\textcite{farazmand2012computing}. In particular, the set $\mathcal{U}_{0}$
was reduced to its intersections with four horizontal and four vertical lines.
The set $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ for the double gyre system, as well as the
aforementioned intersections, are illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:u0_domain}.
The reduced set of strain initial conditions consists of 1470 grid points, which
is two orders of magnitude less than the total number of points in
$\mathcal{U}_{0}$.

\input{mainmatter/method/figures/u0_domain.tex}

The degenerate points of the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$ vector field is, as the name
implies, the set of points in $\mathcal{U}$ for which the eigenvalues
$\lambda_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})$ and $\lambda_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})$ are equal, leaving
the strain eigenvector field $\vct{\xi}_{1}$ undiscernible. As a computational
measure of this degeneracy, the scalar field defined as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:alphafield}
    \alpha(\vct{x}_{0})=\Big(\dfrac{%
                        \lambda_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})-\lambda_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})}%
                    {\lambda_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})+\lambda_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})}\Big)^{2}
\end{equation}

was used. For points $\vct{x}$ which did not coincide with the grid points
$\vct{x}_{i,j}$, the values $\lambda_{1}(\vct{x})$ and $\lambda_{2}(\vct{x})$
were found by means of regular linear interpolation. Wherever the value of
$\alpha(\vct{x})$ decreased below the predefined threshold of $10^{-6}$, the
point $\vct{x}$ was flagged as degenerate, thus stopping the strainline
integration.

Because there is no a priori way of knowing that the selected strain initial
conditions, shown in figure~\ref{fig:u0_domain}, are not in fact located
somewhere in the middle of a strainline, two strainline segments were computed
and merged for each initial condition. One moving forwards in pseudotime, and
one moving  backwards, i.e., using the $180\si{\degree}$ rotated
$\vct{\xi}_{1}$ vector field in the system given by equation
\eqref{eq:strainlineode}. This ensured that no strainline was cut prematurely,
purely as a consequence of the reduced number of strain initial conditions.
Furthermore, the classical Runge-Kutta method with a pseudotime step length
$\Delta=10^{-3}$ was used in order to compute all of the strainlines,
regardless of the integration method used in the advection of the tracers,
described in \cref{sec:advecting_a_set_of_initial_conditions}.
This choice was made because this project is centered around the dependence
of the choice of integration method in the tracer advection. The step length
was chosen by similar logic as presented in
\cref{sub:on_the_choice_of_numerical_step_lengths_and_tolerance_levels};
however, there is no way of knowing in advance, how long (in terms of numerical
integration steps) any given strainline will be. For this reason, it is
impossible to estimate the accumulated floating-point arithmetic errors in
advance. Regardless, we expect diminishing returns in terms of numerical
accuracy by lowering the step length even further, because the accuracy is
always bounded from below by the inherent accuracy of the double-precision
floating-point numbers.

Frequently, only a segment of any given strainline will qualify as a hyperbolic
LCS\@. Hence, the integration of any strainline can be stopped when it reaches
a point at which one of the conditions~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence1} or
\eqref{eq:numericalexistence2} fails. Doing so uncritically, however, opens up
the possibility of stopping a strainline which only exited the $\mathcal{U}_{0}$
domain due to numerical noise. In order to avoid such unwanted failures,
the approach of \textcite{farazmand2012computing} was followed, where
strainline integration is only stopped if one of the aforementioned LCS
conditions fail repeatedly over the pre-set length $l_{f}=0.2$ of the
strainline. Furthermore, the strainlines which were stopped because
of continuous failure of LCS conditions were cut such that their \emph{new}
endpoints in either direction, as seen from the strain initial condition, were
the last point on which the \emph{original} strainline satisfied the
aforementioned conditions.

\subsubsection{Identifying strainlines which are local strain maximizers}
\label{ssub:identifying_strainlines_which_are_local_strain_maximizers}


Now, having located the strainline pieces which satisfy conditions
\eqref{eq:numericalexistence1} and~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence2}, the next
step is imposing condition~\eqref{eq:numericalexistence4}, i.e., identifying the
strainline segments that are local maxima of the averaged maximum strain. The
suggested approach of \textcite{farazmand2012computing} is to define a set
$\mathcal{L}$ of uniformly spaced horizontal and vertical lines within the
domain $\mathcal{U}_{0}$, then comparing the values of
$\overline{\lambda}_{2}(\gamma_{0})$, the average of $\lambda_{2}$ on the curve
$\gamma_{0}$, at the neighboring intersections of all sufficiently close
strainline segments along each of the lines in $\mathcal{L}$. The process is
illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:neighborlcs}.

\input{mainmatter/method/figures/neighborlcs}

Intersections between strainlines and the lines in $\mathcal{L}$ are found
by means of linear interpolation. Should a strainline segment prove to be a
local maximizer along at least one of the lines in $\mathcal{L}$, the strainline
segment is labelled as a LCS\@. Adjacent intersections who are separated by a
distance larger than the preselect threshold $l_{\mathrm{n}}=0.2$ are excluded
from the local maximization process, as indicated in figure
\ref{fig:neighborlcs}. Short LCSs are expected to have negligible impact on the
overall flow pattern. In order to filter out such miniscule structures, any
strainline segment which was shorter than the pre-set small length
$l_{\mathrm{min}}=1$ were discarded as LCS candidates, as suggested in
\textcite{farazmand2012computing}.

One shortcoming in the work of \textcite{farazmand2012computing}, is that
they do not provide a general, robust way of selecting the lines in
$\mathcal{L}$. However, a robust way of identifying strainlines
which are local strain maximizers seemingly has not yet been unambigously
determined in the literature. For this reason,
\citeauthor{farazmand2012computing}'s approach was used, with a set of lines
determined by studying the domain $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ (as shown in
figure~\ref{fig:u0_domain}) in relation
to the $\lambda_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})$ distribution, as well as the FTLE field
(described in \cref{sec:ftle_fields_as_predictors_for_lcss}), where the latter
two are shown in figure~\ref{fig:ftle_l2}.

By inspection of figure~\ref{fig:u0_domain}, we expect there to exist
strainline segments in the upper right part of the computational domain.
So, if any of the lines in $\mathcal{L}$ pass through this region, we
must expect to find one or more strainline segments which are labelled as
LCSs. From figure~\ref{fig:ftle_l2}, one may infer that the local strain in the
region is relatively small, seeing as there is practically no discernible
structure there at all in the $\lambda_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})$ distribution, whereas
the FTLE values there are also very small. From this, it follows that any
hypothetical LCSs located in this region will have a relatively small impact on
the overall flow in the system, at least compared with other hypothetical LCSs
which lie on, or near, the recognizable ridges. The same logic is practically
applicable on the entirety of the computational domain.

In order to eliminate the weakest among the LCSs, it is thus clear that the
lines in $\mathcal{L}$ must be selected carefully. Here, we used the approach
of generating the set $\mathcal{L}$ in order to maximize the number of
intersections with the computed strainlines, using as few lines as possible.
Using two vertical and two horizontal lines, given by $x=0.15$, $x=1.05$,
$y=0.05$ and $y=0.95$, respectively, proved sufficient in order to accurately
reproduce the same LCS as found by \textcite{farazmand2012computing}. We can
only assume that \citeauthor{farazmand2012computing} must have done something
similar, as they have been unavailable for communication. The aforementioned LCS
is presented in~\cref{cha:results}, together with the approximations found by
means of the different integrators mentioned in
\cref{sub:the_runge_kutta_methods_under_consideration}, for the parameters
mentioned in
\cref{sub:on_the_choice_of_numerical_step_lengths_and_tolerance_levels}.
