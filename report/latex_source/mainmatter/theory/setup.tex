\section{Setup}
\label{sec:setup}



We consider flow in two-dimensional dynamical systems of the form


\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:odesystem}
\dot{\vct{x}} = \vct{v}(t,\vct{x}),\quad\vct{x}\in\mathcal{U},\quad{}t\in[t_{0},t_{1}],
\end{equation}

i.e., systems defined for the finite time interval $[t_{0},t_{1}]$, on an open,
bounded subset $\mathcal{U}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. In addition, the velocity
field $\vct{v}$ is assumed to be smooth in its arguments. Depending on the
exact nature of the velocity field $\vct{v}$, analytical particle trajectories,
i.e., solutions of system~\eqref{eqn:odesystem}, may or may not be computed.
