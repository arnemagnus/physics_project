    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lagrangian coherent structure: A structure that can separate dynamically
            distinct invariant regions. Invariant retions: All trajectories starting
            out within it, remains within the region, although the region itself
            may move and deform with time.
            \item Lagrangian coherent structure: Landscapes in multidimensional
                landscapes, shaping the flow patterns in dynamical systems.
                \item Motivation: Complex systems, i.e., many-particle nonlinear
                    systems: Need computational shortcuts
                    \item LCS: Principally robust structures which enable us
                        to make predictions regarding the future states of
                        a flow system.
                        \item Examples of real-world application:
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Population growth
\item Predicting the advection of particles by means of oceanic currents or wind
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recent examples: The volcanic eruptions at Eyafjällajökul, and
            at Bali (2017)
    \end{itemize}
                                    \item Predicting where the remnants of an oil spill will end up --> Where to focus
                                        the rescue operation in the short and medium term
